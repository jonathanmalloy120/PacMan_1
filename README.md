# PacMan Factory
A fun little project to fill the screen with PacMen. Enjoy watching them pop into life, and then when you are ready release them and watch them soar across the screen, chattering all the way.

## To Run
Pull down the entire repository, then drag index.html into a browser tab. The expected result will be two buttons in the top right corner, an "Add PacMan" button which, when pressed, will pop a PacMan onto the screen. This button can be pressed any number of times. Pushing the "Start Game" button will send the PacMen off with randomly assigned velocities, chattering as if they are eating pellets along the way. The will bounce off the walls, and change direction when bouncing off the left/right walls of the screen. 

## Future Enhancements
1. Add a way to remove a PacMan from the screen after it has been created. 
2. Alter the speed at which the mouth opens/closes to make it a little less jerky/abrupt
3. Add a way to pause the screen after it has been started. 
4. Add some sore of objective to make this a game rather than simply a fun project to mess with. More controls/ ways to interact with the PacMen would need to be included. 
5. Add classic arcade music.
